# Installing the Eclipse JPF plugin #

Note that this is assuming the latest Eclipse and Java versions, which is Eclipse 4.3.x and Java 7 at the time of this writing. Older versions might or might not work.
There are three different ways to use JPF, which are listed in the order of preference if you want to ensure that you are using the latest plugin version:

### Install from attached plugin jar ###
Alternatively, you can download one of the attached eclipse-jpf_<version>.jar files, place it into your <eclipse>/dropins/plugins directory, and restart Eclipse.

### Install from update site ###
Import the below files to eclipse and you are good to go.
